# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # 240222 for frequent links on browser
  - trigger: ":m2"
    replace: "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/"
  - trigger: ":m1"
    replace: "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/"
  - trigger: ":m0"
    replace: "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/"
  
    # 240403 for icpp init. limitation: "#" not possible
  - trigger: ":ustd"
    replace: "using namespace std;"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%y%m%d"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
