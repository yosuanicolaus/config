" remember to assing to Vim the following shortcuts!
" C-h
" C-l
" C-o
" C-i
" C-v
" C-w Vim uses it to switch windows, the IDE behaviour is mapped to C-k instead
" C-k
" C-m Enter alternative
" C-[ A great Esc key alternative! In the ide, moves caret to code block start.
" C-] Go to definition. In the ide, moves caret to code block end.

" consider NOT assigning to Vim the following shortcuts:
" C-e recent files popup window is very useful
" C-b find occurrences in file popup
" C-u go to super method
" C-q info popup
" C-j We already have j in Vim, better use it for Insert Live Template
" C-n class search

" unsure about assigning to Vim or to IDE
" C-f find or move forward?
" C-r replace or redo?
" C-y
" C-c We already have C-[, don't we?
" C-p kind of not very used withou C-n
" C-s doesn't seem very useful in Vim
" C-t update project in IDEA, something something tag stack in Vim
" C-a I don't use it that much in Vim
" C-x same as above

map <C-i> <Action>(Forward)


" HELLO there~ this is from VsCode+(n)vim -Yosua- style
